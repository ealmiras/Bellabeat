## 5. Suggestions

With the results of the data analysis in mind, let's go back to the questions we wanted to answer in the beginning of the project!

### 1) What are the trends in smart device usage?
The main driver that leads the customer usage is the activity tracker.
It is important to create a strong base of functioning on activity tracker to be able to direct the users onto other functions of the apps.
User loyalty is generally high for activity tracker, however a push effect is needed for the sleep tracker.
It is hard to comment on weight log usage due to the limitations of the data.

### 2) How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
Being a woman-centric business, the lack of demographic information in the data limits the ability to comment on the degree of relatedness of the results to Bellabeat.

### 3) How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?
As a first step, the activity tracker app should be used to attract customers. 

- The Leaf and the Time should be advertised for not only the activity tracker purpose but also the sleep tracker purpose
- Especially for the sleep tracker purpose, the Leaf shows a great potential as it is easier to wear when sleeping compared to a watch
- To increase the loyalty for the sleep tracker, push notifications may be used to remind the users to keep their Leaf on

For the Spring and Membership products, further analysis are needed.
