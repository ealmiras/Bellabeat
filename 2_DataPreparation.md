## 2. Data Preparation
### 2.1. About Datasets

The dataset is publicly available through [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit/code) and owned by MÃ¶bius.

It is generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12.03.2016 - 12.05.2016. 

Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including 
minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.

### 2.2. Data Organisation
The dataset includes 18 csv files, which 3 of them are wide-version duplicates.
Each document contains different metrics collected from the user that are assigned a unique user_id.

The files include 
- 1 file for daily activity data, 
- 14 files for steps, intensities, and calories data on day, hour and minute bases (together with the previously mentioned duplicated files), 
- 3 files for heartrate, sleep, and weight data

*The first problem I came across during the project was in this step. Considering that the number of rows in the document in not big, I decided to use MS Excel to conduct the pre-control of the data. However, as the date version of the document is in mm.dd.yyyy format as opposed to my computer settings being in dd.mm.yyyy format, I could not import the data to Excel using PowerQuery on Mac without losing data (the Mac version of Excel doesn't have the Power Query Editor feature yet as of today -01.05.2022) For a quick solution, I changed the region setting for Excel through computer settings.*

### 2.3. Data Limitations
The survey is announced to have data for the dates between 12.03 and 12.05, however from the dataset includes data only for the dates between **12.04 and 12.05**
- The limited time frame of the data may result with inconsistencies when compared with the long-term usage of the app

The survey is conducted with 33 users in total, however
- Only the activity data includes all 33 users (information on steps, intensities, and calories)
- Sleep data includes 24 users, which 9 of them have under 10 days of input
- Heart rate data includes 14 users
- Weight data includes only 8 users, which 6 of them have 5 or less days of input

Together with the inconsistent number of entries for different metrics, the data lacks the demographic data of the users, especially the gender information
- Bellabeat is a woman-centric company, for that reason the gender information of the data would be valuable

Finally, the dataset doesn't contain current data, the survey has been conducted in 2016.

*Keeping the limitations listed above in mind, the data can still be used to get an overall idea, however for an in depth analysis, the usage of another dataset that is more broad and current is advised*
