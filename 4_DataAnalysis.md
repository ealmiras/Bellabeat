## 3. Data Analysis

### 3.1. User Engagement
To begin with, I decided to first analyse the user engagement.
I used histogram charts to and median values.

We can see that there's a high level user engagement for the Activity and Sleep trackers.
Especially for the activity tracker, the median of the usage is 30 days out of 31 days in total for the period.

For the weight tracker data, as there are a pretty limited number of users, statistical analysis would mislead.
Due to the nature of the data, it is expected that the users log their data less frequently, probable that less frequent than once a month.
To be able to statistically comment on the user engagement, it is recommended to analyse a bigger dataset.

However, for the sake of curiosity, I checked the data to see if there's any pattern regarding the common days/periods users log their weight on app.
As we have the data of only one month, it's hard to see a pattern.
For the weekly data, we can say that it's more probable of the users to log their weight data in the first half of the week, and the least probable on Friday and Saturdays.
